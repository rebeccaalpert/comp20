#About this repository

This git repository showcases what I learned in the fall 2015 session of Ming Chow's [Comp 20: Web Programming](http://tuftsdev.github.io/WebProgramming/).

My favorite assignment was assignment 3, building the server for Mapchat. It was a real challenge for me, but it was so, so satisfying when I hooked it up to Mapchat and saw that it worked. I liked how it folded two assignments into one functional web application; it gave me a better idea of how to build applications in general.

I've learned so much over the course of this, well, course. I came in with a background in HTML email development, which means HTML tables and a little CSS. Now, I'm comfortable building basic server-side functions, working with MongoDB, doing basic responsive design, writing clean, kick-ass HTML and CSS, parsing JSON, and writing Markdown. I'm comfortable working with API now, too, which is just amazing to me.

I've been given additional responsibilities at work based on what I've learned in this course, and I was able to develop a name-processing utility for Tufts' #GivingTuesday donor roll using what I learned from Captainslog.

Out of all the things I learned, though, I feel that learning how to use git was the most important. Simple, I know, but prior to this course, I'd never quite figured out how to use it. Now, I think it's pretty freaking awesome. I've used it to easily deploy simple projects, store back-ups of my programs, and share code with others. Plus, seeing the little Contributions chart on my profile is pretty motivating.

Now that I've finished the course, I want to dig deeper into responsive design. I'm really fascinated by user interface design, and responsive design folds right into it. I also think [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) is the bomb.com, and I basically want to make weird, beautiful webpages forever.
