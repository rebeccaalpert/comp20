Comp 20 Lab: Responsive Design

What aspects of the work have been correctly implemented and what have not:
* Implemented eight media queries, each of which displays a different frame of homer.jpg (which frame for each query had been specified in the assignment description at http://tuftsdev.github.io/WebProgramming/assignments/lab-responsive.html).

Identify anyone with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment:
* No one! I looked at Piazza though, and Daniel Jay Baigel's "max-device-width vs. max-width" note saved me a lot of time (thanks!)
