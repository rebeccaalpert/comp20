	<h1>Security Analysis of Dan Baigel's MapChat Application</h1>
	<p>Prepared by Rebecca Alpert</p>

	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>This document assess the security of the <a href="https://arcane-thicket-5975.herokuapp.com/">MapChat web application</a> developed by Dan Baigel for Comp 20 assignments <a href="http://tuftsdev.github.io/WebProgramming/assignments/a2.html">2</a> and <a href="http://tuftsdev.github.io/WebProgramming/assignments/a3.html">3</a>.</p>
	<p>The web application, according to the specs, retrieves and stores the current location and message of the client if the client's username is within an approved list of usernames, and then retreives and displays the locations and messages of each user on a map. The server possesses several functions: a POST /sendLocation API, a GET /latest.json API, and a homepage that displays the list of locations and messages for all logins.</p>
	<p>I was assigned to identify at least three security or privacy vulnerabilities in the application.</p>

	<h1>Methodology</h1>
	<p>Initially, I performed black-box testing using curl.</p>

	<h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>
	<p>Provide an overview of all the security and privacy issues you identified. This section should be written for non-technical managers who do not have technical expertise and do not have time to read the entire document. Write this section using lay language.</p>

	<h1>Issues Found</h1>
	<p>For each issue that you find, document:
Issue (e.g., database injection, really bad programming practice)
Location / page where issue was found
Severity of issue (e.g., low, medium , or high). Justify your answer.
Description of issue. How did you find it? A screenshot of problem is excellent.
Proof of vulnerability. Screenshots are important.
Resolution. Make recommendation(s) on how issue can be resolved. Show code if possible.</p>
